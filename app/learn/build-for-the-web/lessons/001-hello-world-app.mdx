## Introduction 🧭

- In this lesson, you'll build your **first working web app**.
- Not a demo.
- Not a screenshot.
- A real app that runs in the browser.
- This lesson exists for one reason only:
  > To prove that your code can appear on the screen.
- We will **not** focus on:
  - Layout
  - Styling systems
  - Components
  - Logic

- We are laying the **foundation** everything else will stand on.

## What You'll Build 🎯

- By the end of this lesson, you'll have:
  - A running React Router v7 app.
  - A home page route.
  - A visible UI element.
  - Tailwind CSS confirmed to be working.

<img
	src={helloWorldAppFinalResultUrl}
	alt='Screenshot of Hello World App showing a red heading'
	className='border-(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06)) mb-10 rounded-lg border'
/>

- Below is the **complete result** for this lesson.
- Don't worry about understanding it yet.
- We will **earn it step by step**.

```tsx
export default function Home() {
	return (
		<h1 className='m-4 text-4xl font-bold text-red-600'>
			Hello, World!
		</h1>
	)
}
```

- This lesson is not about beauty.
- It's about **confirmation**.

## Mental Model 🧠

- Before writing any code, understand this idea:
  > A web app is just **a function that returns UI**.
- At the beginning:
  - There is no layout.
  - No styling decisions.
  - No interaction.
  - No state.
- Just:
  - A file.
  - A function.
  - Something rendered on the page.
- Everything you build later depends on this working first.

## Create the Project 🏗️

- 👉 Create a new project for this lesson:

```bash
npx create-react-router@latest 001-hello-world-app
```

- Move into the project folder and start the server:

```bash
cd 001-hello-world-app
npm run dev
```

- Open [http://localhost:5173 ↗](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.
- 👀 You should see the default React Router welcome screen.
- That screen means:
  - The project works
  - The server runs
  - The browser is connected

<hr className='my-8' />

- ⚠️ **Important note before continuing**
  - This next section looks long — but it's **setup you won't touch again**.
  - Read it once, copy carefully, then forget about it.

## Code Formatting (Prettier) ✨

- This project uses **Prettier** to keep code formatting consistent.

- You don't need to think about spacing, quotes, or semicolons — Prettier
  handles that automatically when you save a file.

### Step 1: Create the Prettier config file

- 📄 In the project root, create a file named **`prettier.config.cjs`**.

  > 💡 Why `.cjs`?  
  > Tooling configuration files are kept in CommonJS format for maximum.
  > compatibility with editors and plugins.

### Step 2: Add the Prettier configuration

Paste the following code into `prettier.config.cjs`:

```js
/** @type {import('prettier').Config} */
module.exports = {
	arrowParens: 'avoid',
	bracketSameLine: false,
	bracketSpacing: true,
	embeddedLanguageFormatting: 'auto',
	endOfLine: 'lf',
	htmlWhitespaceSensitivity: 'css',
	jsxSingleQuote: true,
	printWidth: 80,
	proseWrap: 'always',
	quoteProps: 'as-needed',
	semi: false,
	singleQuote: true,
	singleAttributePerLine: false,
	tabWidth: 2,
	trailingComma: 'all',
	useTabs: true,

	plugins: ['prettier-plugin-tailwindcss'],

	overrides: [
		{
			files: ['**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'],
			options: { singleAttributePerLine: true },
		},
		{
			files: ['**/*.json'],
			options: { useTabs: false },
		},
		{
			files: ['**/*.mdx'],
			options: { proseWrap: 'preserve' },
		},
	],
}
```

- **What this configuration does:**
  - Formats code automatically on save.
  - Uses **single quotes**.
  - Omits **semicolons**.
  - Keeps JSX readable and consistent.
  - Preserves formatting in MDX files.
  - Works smoothly with Tailwind CSS.
  - You don't need to change this file during the lesson.

- You won't need to modify this file during the lesson.
- Just write code and save — Prettier does the rest.

## Linting (ESLint) 🧹

- This project uses the **same ESLint configuration I use in production**.
- That means the tooling you see here is not "tutorial-only" or simplified.
- It's the real setup used in a professional codebase.
- You may notice warnings in your editor as you write code.
- That's expected.
- For now, keep this mental model:
  - ESLint does **not** stop your app from running.
  - Warnings are safe to ignore at this stage.
  - Each rule will make sense as your understanding grows.
- Think of ESLint as a **background guardrail**, not something you need to
  actively manage yet.

### Step 1: Create the ESLint config file

- 📄 In the project root, create a file named `eslint.config.js`.

### Step 2: Add the production ESLint configuration

- Paste the following code into `eslint.config.js`:

```js
import tseslint from '@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin'
import eslintPluginImport from 'eslint-plugin-import'
import eslintPluginUnusedImports from 'eslint-plugin-unused-imports'
import parser from '@typescript-eslint/parser'

export default [
	{
		ignores: [
			'**/node_modules/**',
			'**/dist/**',
			'**/build/**',
			'.react-router/types/**',
			'prisma/generated/**',
			'**/*.test.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}',
			'**/tests/**',
			'*.cjs',
			'eslint.config.js',
		],
	},
	{
		files: ['**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'],
		plugins: {
			'@typescript-eslint': tseslint,
			import: eslintPluginImport,
			'unused-imports': eslintPluginUnusedImports,
		},
		languageOptions: {
			parser,
			ecmaVersion: 'latest',
			sourceType: 'module',
			parserOptions: {
				project: ['./tsconfig.json'],
			},
		},
		rules: {
			'no-unused-vars': 'off',
			'@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars': [
				'warn',
				{ varsIgnorePattern: '^_', argsIgnorePattern: '^_' },
			],
			'unused-imports/no-unused-imports': 'warn',
			'@typescript-eslint/no-floating-promises': 'warn',
			'import/order': [
				'warn',
				{
					groups: [
						'builtin',
						'external',
						'internal',
						'parent',
						'sibling',
						'index',
						'object',
						'type',
					],
					'newlines-between': 'always',
					alphabetize: { order: 'asc', caseInsensitive: true },
				},
			],
		},
	},
]
```

- **What to expect from this setup:**
  - ESLint highlights unused imports.
  - It warns when async work is not awaited.
  - It keeps imports structured and predictable.

- You are **not expected to fix every warning immediately**.
- We'll return to these rules later, when they naturally connect to what
  you're building.
- For now, focus on structure and understanding, not tooling perfection.

## Clean Up the Starter Code 🧹

- 💡 **Mental model**: Each file in `app/routes` represents a page.
- 🗑️ Delete the `app/routes/welcome` folder and its contents.
- ✏️ Open `app/routes/home.tsx`.
- This file represents the **home page** of your app.

<hr className='my-8' />

## Step 1: Make something appear 🧪

- The objective of this step is simple:

  > Make sure your code shows up in the browser.

- ⚠️ **Note**
  - This is the **only time** we'll use **red text** in this lesson.
  - It exists for one reason:
    > To clearly confirm that Tailwind CSS is working
- ✏️ Replace the contents of home.tsx with:

```tsx
export default function Home() {
	return (
		<h1 className='m-4 text-4xl font-bold text-red-600'>
			Hello, World!
		</h1>
	)
}
```

### What this file represents

- `home.tsx` is a **route file**.
- In React Router Framework Mode:
  - A file named home.tsx.
  - Automatically becomes the home page.
- You didn't configure routing.
- You didn’t wire anything manually.
- The framework handled it.

### Line-by-line explanation 🧠

#### 1️⃣ `export default`

```ts
export default function Home() {
```

- React Router expects **one default export** per route file.
- That export is what gets rendered on the page.

#### 2️⃣ `function Home()`

- This is a React **component**.
- A component is just a function.
- Its only job:
  > Return UI.

#### 3️⃣ `return (...)`

- Whatever is returned here:
  - Becomes visible in the browser
- No return → no UI

#### 4️⃣ JSX

```tsx
<h1 className='text-4xl font-bold text-red-600 m-4'>
```

- This looks like HTML.
- It's actually JSX.
- JSX lets you write UI inside JavaScript.

- Important detail:
  - We use `className`, not `class`.

#### 5️⃣ Tailwind classes

- `text-4xl` → large text.
- `font-bold` → strong emphasis.
- `text-red-600` → visible confirmation.
- `m-4` → spacing around the element.

These styles apply **only** to this element.

### What you should see 👀

- A large red heading that says:
  > Hello, World!

<img
	src={helloWorldAppFinalResultUrl}
	alt='Hello World app showing red heading confirming the app renders'
	className='border-(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06)) mb-10 rounded-lg border'
/>

- If you see this:
  - The app runs.
  - The route works.
  - Tailwind is active.
- That's a win.

### Why we stop here

- We do **not** add:
  - Layout
  - Components
  - Styling systems
  - Interaction
- This lesson exists to establish confidence, not complexity.

<hr className='my-8' />

## Wrap Up 🏁

- You've built your **first working web app**.
- Not by memorizing syntax.
- But by understanding a simple idea:
  > A function returns UI → the browser shows it.

### What you can now do

- You can:
  - Run a real project
  - Edit a route file
  - See your code in the browser
  - Confirm your environment works

### What you intentionally did not do

- You did not:
  - Design UI
  - Add layout
  - Add styling systems
  - Add interaction
- That comes next — **when it's earned**.

### What's next → 🚀

- In the next lesson, you'll stop verifying.
- And start **designing structure**.
- One box at a time.
- If you can make _Hello, World!_ appear, you can build anything from here.
