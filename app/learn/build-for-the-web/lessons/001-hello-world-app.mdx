## Introduction 🧭

- In this lesson, you'll build your **first working web app**.
- Not a demo.
- Not a screenshot.
- A real app that runs in the browser.
- This lesson exists for one reason only:
  > To prove that your code can appear on the screen.
- We will **not** focus on:
  - Layout
  - Styling systems
  - Components
  - Logic
- We are laying the **foundation** everything else will stand on.
- This project uses the same tools you'll see in real-world React apps.
- For now, you only need to focus on one thing:
  > Making something appear on the screen.

<hr className='my-8' />

## What You'll Build 🎯

- By the end of this lesson, you'll have:
  - A running React Router v7 app.
  - A home page route.
  - A visible UI element.
  - Tailwind CSS confirmed to be working.

<img
	src={helloWorldAppFinalResultUrl}
	alt='Screenshot of Hello World App showing a red heading'
	className='border-(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06)) mb-10 rounded-lg border'
/>

- Below is the **complete code** for this lesson.
- Don't worry about understanding it yet.
- We will **earn it step by step**.

```tsx
export default function Home() {
	return (
		<h1 className='m-4 text-4xl font-bold text-red-600'>
			Hello, World!
		</h1>
	)
}
```

- This lesson is not about beauty.
- It's about **confirmation**.

<hr className='my-8' />

## Mental Model 🧠

- Before writing any code, understand this idea:
  > A web app is just **a function that returns UI**.
- At the beginning:
  - There is no layout.
  - No styling decisions.
  - No interaction.
  - No state.
- Just:
  - A file.
  - A function.
  - Something rendered on the page.
- Everything you build later depends on this working first.

<hr className='my-8' />

## Create the Project 🏗️

- 👉 Create a new project for this lesson:

```bash
npx create-react-router@latest 001-hello-world-app
```

- Move into the project folder and start the server:

```bash
cd 001-hello-world-app
npm run dev
```

- Open [http://localhost:5173 ↗](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.
- 👀 You should see the default React Router welcome screen.
- That screen means:
  - The project works
  - The server runs
  - The browser is connected

<hr className='my-8' />

- ⚠️ **Important note before continuing**
  - This next section looks long — but it's **setup you won't touch again**.
  - Read it once, copy carefully, then forget about it.

## Clean Up the Starter Code 🧹

- 💡 **Mental model**: Each file in `app/routes` represents a page.
- 🗑️ Delete the `app/routes/welcome` folder and its contents.
- ✏️ Open `app/routes/home.tsx`.
- This file represents the **home page** of your app.

<hr className='my-8' />

## Step 1: Make something appear 🧪

- The objective of this step is simple:

  > Make sure your code shows up in the browser.

- ⚠️ **Note**
  - This is the **only time** we'll use **red text** in this lesson.
  - It exists for one reason:
    > To clearly confirm that Tailwind CSS is working
- ✏️ Replace the contents of home.tsx with:

```tsx
export default function Home() {
	return (
		<h1 className='m-4 text-4xl font-bold text-red-600'>
			Hello, World!
		</h1>
	)
}
```

### What this file represents

- `home.tsx` is a **route file**.
- In React Router Framework Mode:
  - A file named home.tsx.
  - Automatically becomes the home page.
- You didn't configure routing.
- You didn’t wire anything manually.
- The framework handled it.

### Line-by-line explanation 🧠

#### 1️⃣ `export default`

```ts
export default function Home() {
```

- React Router expects **one default export** per route file.
- That export is what gets rendered on the page.

#### 2️⃣ `function Home()`

- This is a React **component**.
- A component is just a function.
- Its only job:
  > Return UI.

#### 3️⃣ `return (...)`

- Whatever is returned here:
  - Becomes visible in the browser
- No return → no UI

#### 4️⃣ JSX

```tsx
<h1 className='text-4xl font-bold text-red-600 m-4'>
```

- This looks like HTML.
- It's actually JSX.
- JSX lets you write UI inside JavaScript.

- Important detail:
  - We use `className`, not `class`.

#### 5️⃣ Tailwind classes

- `text-4xl` → large text.
- `font-bold` → strong emphasis.
- `text-red-600` → visible confirmation.
- `m-4` → spacing around the element.

These styles apply **only** to this element.

### What you should see 👀

- A large red heading that says:
  > Hello, World!

<img
	src={helloWorldAppFinalResultUrl}
	alt='Hello World app showing red heading confirming the app renders'
	className='border-(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06)) mb-10 rounded-lg border'
/>

- If you see this:
  - The app runs.
  - The route works.
  - Tailwind is active.
- That's a win.

### Why we stop here

- We do **not** add:
  - Layout
  - Components
  - Styling systems
  - Interaction
- This lesson exists to establish confidence, not complexity.

<hr className='my-8' />

## Wrap Up 🏁

- You've built your **first working web app**.
- Not by memorizing syntax.
- But by understanding a simple idea:
  > A function returns UI → the browser shows it.

### What you can now do

- You can:
  - Run a real project
  - Edit a route file
  - See your code in the browser
  - Confirm your environment works

### What you intentionally did not do

- You did not:
  - Design UI
  - Add layout
  - Add styling systems
  - Add interaction
- That comes next — **when it's earned**.

### What's next → 🚀

- In the next lesson, you'll stop verifying.
- And start **designing structure**.
- One box at a time.
- If you can make _Hello, World!_ appear, you can build anything from here.
