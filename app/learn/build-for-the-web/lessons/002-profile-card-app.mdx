## Introduction 🧭

- In this lesson, you'll build your first **real UI** — a Profile Card.
- Unlike the Hello World App, this lesson introduces **layout**, **spacing**,
  **images**, and **buttons**.
- You will write **all the code in one file** so you can clearly see how JSX
  becomes UI.

<hr className='my-8' />

## What You'll Build 🎯

- By the end of this lesson, you'll have a Profile Card that displays:
  - A profile image (avatar)
  - A name and role
  - A short bio
  - Two action buttons

<img
	src={profileCardAppFinalResultUrl}
	alt='Screenshot of final Profile Card app'
	className='border-(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06)) mb-10 rounded-lg border'
/>

- Below is the **complete code** for the Profile Card App you'll build in this lesson.
- Don't worry about understanding it yet — we'll build it **step by step**.

```tsx
import cartoonAntelopeAvatar from '~/assets/Cartoon-Antelope-Avatar.png?url'

export default function Home() {
	return (
		<div className='flex min-h-screen items-center justify-center bg-slate-100 p-6'>
			{/* Card */}
			<div className='w-full max-w-sm rounded-2xl border bg-white p-6 text-center'>
				{/* Avatar */}
				<div className='mx-auto flex h-24 w-24 items-center justify-center rounded-full bg-slate-100'>
					<img
						src={cartoonAntelopeAvatar}
						alt='Profile avatar'
						className='h-20 w-20 rounded-full object-cover'
					/>
				</div>

				{/* Name */}
				<h2 className='mt-4 text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900'>
					Peter Olum
				</h2>

				{/* Role */}
				<p className='text-sm text-slate-500'>Modern Fullstack Web Developer</p>

				{/* Bio */}
				<p className='mt-4 text-sm text-slate-500'>Simplifying the web</p>

				{/* Actions */}
				<div className='mt-6 flex gap-3'>
					<button
						type='button'
						className='flex-1 cursor-pointer rounded-lg border px-4 py-2 text-sm transition hover:bg-slate-100'
					>
						Message
					</button>

					<button
						type='button'
						className='flex-1 rounded-lg bg-blue-600 px-4 py-2 text-sm text-white transition hover:bg-blue-700'
					>
						Follow
					</button>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
	)
}
```

- You are **not expected to write or understand this yet**.
- The rest of the lesson is about **earning this code**, one decision at a time.
- You'll build this using:
  - React
  - TypeScript
  - React Router v7 (Framework Mode)
  - Tailwind CSS
- Everything you need is already configured for you.
- You don't need to master them yet — just use them.

<hr className='my-8' />

## Mental Model 🧠

- Before writing any code, understand this idea:

  > A web UI is just **boxes arranged with spacing**.

- Think about the structure first — not the styling.

```text
Page
└── Card
    ├── Avatar
    ├── Name
    ├── Role
    ├── Bio
    └── Actions
```

- You are not designing art.
- You are arranging elements.

<hr className='my-8' />

## Create the Project 🏗️

- 👉 Create a new project for this lesson:

```bash
npx create-react-router@latest 002-profile-card-app
```

- Move into the project folder and start the server:

```bash
cd 002-profile-card-app
npm run dev
```

- Open [http://localhost:5173 ↗](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

- 👀 You should see the default React Router welcome screen.

<hr className='my-8' />

## Clean Up the Starter Code 🧹

- 💡 **Mental model:** Each file in `app/routes` represents a page.
- 🗑️ Delete the `app/routes/welcome` folder and its contents.
- ✏️ Open `app/routes/home.tsx`
- You'll now build the Profile Card **one step at a time**.

<hr className='my-8' />

## Step 1: Verify the setup with a simple heading 🧪

- The objective of this step is to confirm 👀:
  - The home page route works
  - Tailwind CSS has been set up correctly

- ⚠️ **Note**
  - This is the only time we'll use **red text** in this lesson.  
    It's intentional — just to clearly confirm that Tailwind CSS is working.

✏️ Replace the Home Page Code with the following code:

```tsx
export default function Home() {
	return <h1 className='m-4 text-4xl font-bold text-red-600'>Home page</h1>
}
```

### What `home.tsx` file represents

- The `home.tsx` file represents a **page** in your application.
- In React Router v7 (Framework Mode), a file named `home.tsx` inside `app/routes`
  automatically becomes the **home page** of your app.

### Line-by-line explanation

#### 1️⃣ `export default`

```ts
export default function Home() {
```

- This makes the function available to the rest of the app.
- React Router expects each route file to export **one default component**.
- That exported function is what gets rendered on the page.

- Think of it as:

  > This is the main thing this file provides.

<hr className='my-8' />

#### 2️⃣ `function Home()`

```ts
function Home() {
```

- This defines a JavaScript function named `Home`.
- In React, a function like this is called a **component**.
- A component's job is simple:
  > Return UI
- The name `Home` matches the route:
  - `home.tsx` → `Home` component → home page

#### 3️⃣ `return (...)`

```ts
return (
```

- Whatever is returned here becomes **visible in the browser**.
- React reads this return value and turns it into real HTML.
- If a component returns nothing, nothing appears on the page.

#### 4️⃣ JSX: HTML-like syntax inside JavaScript

```tsx
<h1 className="text-4xl font-bold text-red-600 m-4">
```

- This looks like HTML, but it's actually JSX:
  - JSX lets you write HTML-like elements inside JavaScript.
  - React converts JSX into real DOM elements.
- Important detail:
  - In JSX, we use `className`, not `class`.
  - This is because `class` is a reserved word in JavaScript.

#### 5️⃣ The `<h1>` element

```tsx
<h1>Home page</h1>
```

- `<h1>` is a standard HTML heading.
- It represents the **main heading** of the page.
- Screen readers and search engines treat it as the page's title.

#### 6️⃣ Tailwind CSS classes (styling)

```tsx
className = 'text-4xl font-bold text-red-600 m-4'
```

- These classes come from Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework.
- Here's what each class does:
  - `text-4xl` → makes the text large.
  - `font-bold` → makes the text bold.
  - `text-red-600` → applies a red color.
  - `m-4` → adds margin around the heading.

- These styles:
  - Apply only to this element
  - Do not affect the rest of the page

### What happens when the app runs

When the app loads:

    1. React Router loads the `home.tsx` file
    1. It calls the `Home()` function
    1. The function returns JSX
    1. React converts that JSX into HTML
    1. The browser displays:

> A large, bold, red heading that says "Home page" as shown below:

<img
	src={profileCardAppstep1Url}
	alt='Profile Card App Step 1 showing a red heading confirming the home page renders.'
	className='border-(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06)) mb-10 rounded-lg border'
/>

### Key takeaway 🧠

- In this step, you learned:
  - A route file represents a **page** in your app
  - A React component is just a **function that returns UI**
  - Whatever a component returns is what appears in the browser
  - JSX lets you write HTML-like syntax inside JavaScript
- This step was not about building UI yet.
- It was about confirming that:
  - The app runs
  - The route works
  - Tailwind CSS is active
- Once this foundation is confirmed, we can safely start building real UI.

### Next step →

Move from verification to structure

## Step 2: Define the structure of the Profile Card 🧱

- In this step, we stop testing the setup and start **designing the UI structure**.
  - We are not styling anything yet
  - We are not centering the card yet
  - We are only deciding:
    - What elements exist
    - How they are grouped
    - How they are nested
- Think of this step as drawing the skeleton of the UI.

### The complete code for this step

```tsx
import cartoonAntelopeAvatar from '~/assets/Cartoon-Antelope-Avatar.png?url'

export default function Home() {
	return (
		<div>
			{/* Card */}
			<div>
				{/* Avatar */}
				<div>
					<img
						src={cartoonAntelopeAvatar}
						alt='Profile Avatar'
					/>
				</div>

				{/* Name */}
				<h2>Peter Olum</h2>

				{/* Role */}
				<p>Modern Fullstack Web Developer</p>

				{/* Bio */}
				<p>Simplifying the web</p>

				{/* Actions */}
				<div>
					<button type='button'>Message</button>
					<button type='button'>Follow</button>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
	)
}
```

### Line-by-line explanation 🧠

#### 1️⃣ Importing the avatar image

```ts
import cartoonAntelopeAvatar from '~/assets/Cartoon-Antelope-Avatar.png?url'
```

- This line imports an image file so it can be used inside JSX.
- The `?url` tells the build system:
  > Give me the image URL, not the file itself.
- This allows us to use the image like this later:

```tsx
<img src={cartoonAntelopeAvatar} />
```

- At this stage, don't worry about how this works internally.
- Just know: **this is how images enter React components**.

#### 2️⃣ The outer page container

```tsx
<div>
```

- This is the **page-level container**.
- Everything visible on the home page lives inside this element.

- Think of it as:

  > The canvas on which the rest of the UI will sit.

- We'll style and position this container later.

#### 3️⃣ The Card container

```tsx
{/* Card */}
<div>
```

- This `<div>` represents the **Profile Card itself**.
- Everything related to the profile belongs inside this container.
- This is an important habit:
  > Group related UI into one parent container.
- Later, this card will:
  - Get a background
  - Get spacing
  - Get rounded corners
- For now, it's just a box.

#### 4️⃣ Avatar section

```tsx
{/* Avatar */}
<div>
	<img
		src={cartoonAntelopeAvatar}
		alt='Profile Avatar'
	/>
</div>
```

- What's happening here:
  - The outer `<div>` represents the **avatar area**.
  - The `<img>` element displays the profile image
- Why wrap the image in a `<div>`?
- Because:
  - The container controls **layout**
  - The image controls **content**
- This separation will matter when we start styling.

#### 5️⃣ The Name

```tsx
<h2>Peter Olum</h2>
```

- `<h2>` is a semantic HTML heading.
- It represents the **name of the person** on the card.

- We are not worrying about size, color, or spacing yet.
- We are only answering:
  > What kind of information is this?
- A name → heading.

#### 6️⃣ The Role

```tsx
<p>Modern Fullstack Web Developer</p>
```

- This is descriptive text, not a heading.
- A `<p>` (paragraph) is the correct semantic choice.
- At this stage, "Role" is just:
  > Text that explains what this person does.

#### 7️⃣ The Bio

```tsx
<p>Simplifying the web</p>
```

- This is another paragraph.
- It represents a short personal description or tagline.
- Even though it looks similar to the role, it has a different meaning:
  - Role → what you do
  - Bio → how you describe yourself
- Meaning comes first. Styling comes later.

#### 8️⃣ The Actions section

```tsx
{/* Actions */}
<div>
	<button type='button'>Message</button>
	<button type='button'>Follow</button>
</div>
```

- This section groups **interactive elements**.
- Important ideas here:
  - Buttons belong together → they share a container.
  - Each `<button>` represents an action the user can take.
- The `type='button'` ensures these buttons:
  - Do not accidentally submit a form
  - Behave predictably as UI actions
- At this point, they don't _do_ anything yet.
- They simply exist.

### What the browser shows at this stage 👀

- Right now, the UI will look:
  - Plain
  - Unstyled
  - Vertically stacked
  - Slightly "ugly"
- That is **expected**.
- This step is about the **skeleton**, not the skin.
- If you can clearly see:
  - An image
  - A name
  - A role
  - A bio
  - Two buttons
- Then this step is complete ✅

> If your screen looks similar to this, you're on the right track.

<img
	src={profileCardAppstep2Url}
	alt='Profile Card App Step 2 showing the unstyled structural layout with avatar, name, role, bio, and action buttons.'
	className='border-(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06)) mb-10 rounded-lg border'
/>

### Key takeaway 🧠

- In this step, you learned:
  - A UI is built by **nesting elements**
  - Grouping is more important than styling
  - `<div>` elements act as **containers**
  - Meaning comes before appearance
- At this stage, the card exists only as **structure**.

### Next step →

Decide where the card lives on the page

## Step 3: Position the Profile Card on the page 🧭

- At this point, the Profile Card exists —
  but it has **no relationship with the page**.
- This step answers one question:
  > Where does the card live?
- We will:
  - Leave the card structure untouched.
  - Control layout **from the outside**.

### Position the card using the page container

- Update the outermost `<div>` to this:

```tsx
<div className='flex min-h-screen items-center justify-center bg-slate-100 p-6'>
```

- Your component now becomes:

```tsx
export default function Home() {
	return (
		<div className='flex min-h-screen items-center justify-center bg-slate-100 p-6'>
			{/* Card */}
			<div>
				{/* Avatar */}
				<div>
					<img src={cartoonAntelopeAvatar} alt='Profile Avatar' />
				</div>

				{/* Name */}
				<h2>Peter Olum</h2>

				{/* Role */}
				<p>Modern Fullstack Web Developer</p>

				{/* Bio */}
				<p>Simplifying the web</p>

				{/* Actions */}
				<div>
					<button type='button'>Message</button>
					<button type='button'>Follow</button>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
	)
}
```

- **Class-by-class breakdown 🧩**
  - `flex`
    → turns the page container into a flex layout.
  - `min-h-screen`
    → ensures the page is at least the height of the viewport.
  - `items-center`
    → centers children vertically.
  - `justify-center`
    → centers children horizontally.
  - `bg-slate-100`
    → provides a soft background so the card can stand out later.
  - `p-6`
    → adds breathing room around the card on smaller screens.

### What changed (conceptually)

- The page now fills the viewport.
- The card is centered vertically and horizontally.
- The background separates **content** from **context**.
- The card itself is still unstyled.
- Only its **placement** has changed.

<img
	src={profileCardAppstep3Url}
	alt='Profile Card App Step 3 showing the card positioned on the page.'
	className='border-(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06)) mb-10 rounded-lg border'
/>

### Key takeaway 🧠

- Layout decisions belong to the **parent**, not the component.
- Positioning is about **where**, not **how it looks**.
- The card now has a clear place on the page.

### Next step →

- Turn the structure into a recognizable card 🎨.

## Step 4: Style the Profile Card 🎨

- At this point, the card is:
  - Structurally correct
  - Positioned correctly
- But it still looks like plain HTML.
  > What makes this feel like a real card?
- We'll do this **in small, visible steps**.

### Step 4a: Style the card container

- First, we define the **boundary** of the card.

- Update the card `<div>`:

```tsx
{/* Card */}
<div className='w-full max-w-sm rounded-2xl border bg-white p-6 text-center'>
```

- The UI now clearly reads as a **card**.

<img
	src={profileCardAppstep4aUrl}
	alt='Profile Card App Step 4a showing the card container with background, border, padding, and rounded corners.'
	className='border-(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06)) mb-10 rounded-lg border'
/>

- **Class-by-class breakdown** 🧩
  - `w-full` → allows the card to fill available width on small screens.
  - `max-w-sm` → keeps the card compact and readable.
  - `rounded-2xl` → softens the edges to suggest a surface.
  - `border` → separates the card from the background.
  - `bg-white` → makes content stand out.
  - `p-6` → adds internal spacing.
  - `text-center` → centers text content.

### Step 4b: Style the avatar

- Next, we make the profile image **intentional**.
- Replace the avatar section with:

```tsx
{/* Avatar */}
<div className='mx-auto flex h-24 w-24 items-center justify-center rounded-full bg-slate-100'>
	<img
		src={cartoonAntelopeAvatar}
		alt='Profile avatar'
		className='h-20 w-20 rounded-full object-cover'
	/>
</div>
```

- **What's happening here:**
  - The outer container defines size and alignment
  - The image is clipped into a circle
  - `object-cover` prevents distortion
- This separation gives you **control**.

<img
	src={profileCardAppstep4bUrl}
	alt='Profile Card App Step 4b showing the avatar constrained to a circular container.'
	className='border-(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06)) mb-10 rounded-lg border'
/>

- **Class-by-class breakdown 🧩**
  - **Outer container**
    - `mx-auto` → horizontally centers the avatar.
    - `flex` → enables precise centering.
    - `h-24 w-24` → defines a fixed square container.
    - `items-center justify-center` → centers the image perfectly
    - `rounded-full` → turns a square container into a circle container.
    - `bg-slate-100` → adds contrast behind the image.
  - **Image**
    - `h-20 w-20` → creates padding inside the container.
    - `rounded-full` → clips the image into a circle.
    - `object-cover` → fills the space without distortion.

### Step 4c: Style the text hierarchy

- Now we clarify **importance** and **reading order**.

- Update the text elements:

```tsx
{/* Name */}
<h2 className='mt-4 text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900'>
	Peter Olum
</h2>

{/* Role */}
<p className='text-sm text-slate-500'>
	Modern Fullstack Web Developer
</p>

{/* Bio */}
<p className='mt-4 text-sm text-slate-500'>
	Simplifying the web
</p>
```

- This establishes:
  - Name → primary
  - Role → secondary
  - Bio → supporting
- Spacing, size, weight, and color do the talking.

<img
	src={profileCardAppstep4cUrl}
	alt='Profile Card App Step 4c showing text hierarchy with spacing, size, and color.'
	className='border-(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06)) mb-10 rounded-lg border'
/>

- **Class-by-class breakdown 🧩**
  - **Name**
    - `mt-4` → separates text from the avatar.
    - `text-xl` → signals importance.
    - `font-semibold` → adds emphasis without heaviness.
    - `text-slate-900` → maximizes readability.
  - **Role**
    - `text-sm` → secondary importance.
    - `text-slate-500` → reduced emphasis.
  - **Bio**
    - `mt-4` → introduces a new idea
    - `text-sm` → supporting size
    - `text-slate-500` → consistent supporting tone

### Step 4d: Style the action buttons

- The card now looks structured and readable.
- But the actions still look like default HTML.
- In this step, we give buttons:
  - Shape
  - Spacing
  - Visual priority
- **No interaction yet** — just appearance.
- Update the actions section:

```tsx
{/* Actions */}
<div className='mt-6 flex gap-3'>
	<button
		type='button'
		className='flex-1 rounded-lg border px-4 py-2 text-sm'
	>
		Message
	</button>
	<button
		type='button'
		className='flex-1 rounded-lg bg-blue-600 px-4 py-2 text-sm text-white'
	>
		Follow
	</button>
</div>
```

- The buttons now feel **intentional**, not accidental.

<img
	src={profileCardAppstep4dUrl}
	alt='Profile Card App Step 4d showing styled action buttons with spacing, shape, and visual priority.'
	className='border-(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06)) mb-10 rounded-lg border'
/>

- **Class-by-class breakdown 🧩**
  - **Actions container**
    - `mt-6`
      → separates actions from content above.
    - `flex`
      → lays buttons out horizontally.
    - `gap-3`
      → creates space between buttons without margins.
  - **Secondary button: "Message"**
    - `flex-1`
      → makes the button expand evenly.
    - `rounded-lg`
      → softens edges to match the card.
    - `border`
      → keeps it visible but understated.
    - `px-4 py-2`
      → creates a comfortable click area.
    - `text-sm`
      → keeps emphasis lower than the primary action.
  - Primary button: "Follow"
    - `flex-1`
      → matches the width of the other button.
    - `rounded-lg`
      → consistent shape language.
    - `bg-blue-600`
      → establishes visual priority.
    - `text-white`
      → ensures contrast and readability.
    - `px-4 py-2`
      → consistent sizing with the secondary button.
    - `text-sm`
      → keeps typography balanced.

### Step 4e: Stop and assess (optional)

- Finally, we check the **overall rhythm**.
- At this stage:
  - Elements are aligned.
  - Spacing feels intentional.
  - Nothing feels crowded or loose.
- This step is about **pausing**, not adding.
- If the card already looks balanced, you are done with styling.

### Key takeaway 🧠

- Styling is a sequence of **small decisions**.
- Containers define layout; content fills them.
- Visual hierarchy replaces explanation.
- Good UI is built, not guessed.

## Step 5: Add visual feedback and finishing touches ✨

- At this point, the Profile Card:
  - Exists
  - Is positioned correctly
  - Looks like a real card
- But it still feels **static**.
- In this step, we add light interaction — not behavior or logic.
- The goal is simple:
  > Help the user feel that elements are interactive.

### 5a: Add hover feedback to the action buttons

- Buttons should **respond** when the user interacts with them.
- We do this with:
  - Cursor feedback
  - Hover states
  - Subtle transitions
- No JavaScript.
- No state.
- No click logic.
- **Update the actions section**

```tsx
{/* Actions */}
<div className='mt-6 flex gap-3'>
	<button
		type='button'
		className='flex-1 cursor-pointer rounded-lg border px-4 py-2 text-sm transition hover:bg-slate-100'
	>
		Message
	</button>
	<button
		type='button'
		className='flex-1 rounded-lg bg-blue-600 px-4 py-2 text-sm text-white transition hover:bg-blue-700'
	>
		Follow
	</button>
</div>
```

- **Why the buttons are styled differently**
  - Not all buttons are equal.
  - One action is **primary**.
  - One action is **secondary**.
- This difference is intentional.

- **Class-by-class breakdown 🧩**
  - **Message button (secondary action)**
    - `flex-1`
      → keeps both buttons the same width.
    - `cursor-pointer`
      → explicitly signals “this is clickable.”
    - `border`
      → keeps the button visible but understated.
    - `hover:bg-slate-100`
      → provides gentle feedback without stealing attention.
    - `transition`
      → makes the hover feel smooth, not abrupt.

- This button says:

  > I'm available, but I'm not the main focus.

- **Follow button (primary action)**

```tsx
className='flex-1 rounded-lg bg-blue-600 px-4 py-2 text-sm text-white transition hover:bg-blue-700'
```

- `bg-blue-600`
  → establishes visual priority.
- `text-white`
  → ensures contrast and readability.
- `hover:bg-blue-700`
  → reinforces intent on interaction.
- `transition`
  → keeps interaction smooth.

Notice:

- We don't need cursor-pointer here.
- Buttons already show a pointer cursor by default.
- The strong color already communicates interactivity.

- This button says:
  > This is the action you're most likely to take.

### Why we stop here

- In this step, we intentionally do **not** add:
  - Click handlers
  - State
  - Modals
  - Application logic
- That belongs in a future lesson.
- What mattered here was learning how to:
  - Signal interactivity
  - Establish action priority
  - Add feedback without behavior
- Not application behavior.

### Key takeaway 🧠

- Interaction doesn't always mean JavaScript.
- Visual feedback can communicate intent.
- Primary and secondary actions should feel different.
- A UI can feel alive **before** it becomes dynamic.

## Wrap Up 🏁

- You've just built your first real UI — not a demo, not a toy, but a complete,
  intentional component.
- In this lesson, you learned how to move from:
  - **Nothing → Structure**
  - **Structure → Layout**
  - **Layout → Styling**
  - **Styling → Perceived interaction**
- All without rushing into logic or complexity.

### What you can now do confidently

- By the end of this lesson, you can:
  - Think about UI as **nested boxes**, not decorations.
  - Separate:
    - Structure
    - Placement
    - Styling
    - Interaction
  - Read Tailwind classes as **decisions**, not magic.
  - Build a clean, centered card layout from scratch.
  - Make a UI feel interactive **without JavaScript**.
- Most importantly, you've learned to **earn complexity** instead of jumping to it.

### What you intentionally did not learn yet

- And that's a good thing.
- You did not add:
  - State
  - Click logic
  - Modals
  - Business behavior
- Those belong in later lessons — when they're deserved.
- Right now, your mental model is clean.

### Carry this forward

- As you continue learning, keep this rule close:

  > - **Structure first.**
  > - **Position second.**
  > - **Style last.**
  > - **Behavior comes after clarity.**

- If you can build a Profile Card this way,
  you can build **any UI** this way.

### What's next → 🚀

- In the next lesson, you'll take your first step into real interactivity —
  introducing state in a way that feels natural, earned, and obvious.
- No surprises.
- No shortcuts.
- Just progress.
