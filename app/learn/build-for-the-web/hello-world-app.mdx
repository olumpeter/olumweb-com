## Introduction 🧭

- In this tutorial, you'll build your first Hello World app using TypeScript,
  Node.js, and React Router v7 (Framework Mode).
- We'll keep it hands-on and beginner-friendly, so by the end, you'll be
  confident working inside the `app/` directory and previewing your app.
- This tutorial is the perfect starting point if you want to **learn modern web
  development using TypeScript** while using a **scaffolded React Router
  project** to simplify setup.

## What You'll Build 🎯

- By the end of this lesson, you'll have a simple web app that displays a red
  "Hello, World!" message, styled with Tailwind CSS, and running on React Router v7.

<img
	src={helloWorldAppFinalResultUrl}
	alt='Screenshot of final Hello World app in browser with red heading'
	className='rounded-lg shadow-md'
/>

- You'll build this from scratch using:
  - TypeScript for type-safe code
  - React Router v7 for app structure
  - Tailwind CSS for styling

## Setting Up Your Coding Environment 🧭

### Install Node.js and VS Code ⚙️

- You'll use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) with an integrated Bash terminal as your
  editor.
- Make sure VS Code and Node.js are installed before continuing.
- 👉 If VS Code is already installed, open it and run the following command in
  the terminal to check whether Node.js is installed:

```bash
node -v
```

- 👀 If Node.js is installed, you should see output similar to:

```bash
v23.11.0
```

- 👀 If you see an error like:

```bash
node: command not found
```

Node.js is not installed on your system.

- 👉 To install it:
  1. Visit [nodejs.org ↗](nodejs.org).
  2. Download the LTS (Long-Term Support) version for your operating system.
  3. Run the installer and follow the setup steps.
  4. Open a new terminal and run `node -v` again to confirm installation.

- 🎯 Once you see a version number, you're ready to continue.

### Create Your Project Folder 🏗️

- 👉 Create a new folder on your desktop called `TypeScript Projects`.
- Open this folder in VS Code using **File → Open Folder…**, or the shortcut:
  - Ctrl+K, Ctrl+O (Windows/Linux)
  - Cmd+K, Cmd+O (macOS)
- This folder will hold your first Hello World app built with TypeScript and
  React Router.

🚀 With your environment ready, let's create the project.

### Scaffold Your First React Router Project 🏗️

- Most real-world apps start from a scaffold. You’ll use the React Router v7
  Framework Mode template, which includes TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
- 👉 Run the following command to create a new project named `001-hello-world-app`:

```bash
npx create-react-router@latest 001-hello-world-app
```

- 👀 Installation may take a few minutes, depending on your internet connection.
- 👀 When it finishes, you should see a new `001-hello-world-app` folder.

> 💡 Tip
> If you see dependency-related errors after scaffolding, run:
>
> ```bash
> npm install
> ```

- 👉 Move into the project directory:

```bash
cd 001-hello-world-app
```

- Inside the project, you’ll find an app/ directory. This is where routes,
  layouts, and components live.
- 👉 Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

- 👉 Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.
- 👀 You should see the default React Router welcome page.
- 🎯 The app is running, but it still shows the default screen. Next, you’ll
  replace it with your own content.

## Clean Up and Configure Your App 🧹

### Replace the Home Page Code ✏️

- ✏️ Replace the contents of app/routes/home.tsx with:

```tsx
export default function Home() {
	return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
}
```

- 🗑️ Delete the welcome folder and its contents.

### Set Up Tailwind CSS ⚙️

- ✏️ Replace the contents of `app/app.css` with:

```css
@import 'tailwindcss';

@theme {
	--font-sans:
		'Inter', ui-sans-serif, system-ui, sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji',
		'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji';
}

@layer base {
	html,
	body {
		font-family: var(--font-sans);
	}
}
```

### Update TypeScript Config ⚙️

- ⚙ Update `tsconfig.json` to suppress deprecation warnings:

```diff
+ "ignoreDeprecations": "6.0"
```

### Verify Tailwind CSS 👀

- ✏️ Update the heading in app/routes/home.tsx:

```diff
- <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
+ <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold text-red-600 m-4">
+   Hello, World!
+ </h1>
```

- 👀 You should now see a large red heading in the browser.

🚀 You've successfully set up a fullstack-ready React Router v7 project.

## Wrap Up 🏁

- You've learned how to:
  - Scaffold a React Router v7 Framework Mode project
  - Configure Tailwind CSS
  - Build and preview a TypeScript-powered Hello World app
